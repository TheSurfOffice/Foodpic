This is a prototype for a beacon based virtual menu. Whenever you are close to the Estimote Beacon installed in the restaurant, the menu with english translation will pop up.

Currently 2 restaurants are supported: [Mumbai Sunset Bar](https://www.facebook.com/MumbaiSunset) and  Nautilus Gastrobar. Both are base in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria close to [The Surf Office](http://www.thesurfoffice.com/gran-canaria).
